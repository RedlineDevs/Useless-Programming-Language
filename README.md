# Useless Programming Language

The programming language that does everything wrong, on purpose! ðŸŽ­

## Features

- `print()` opens random websites instead of printing text
- `add()` subtracts instead of adding
- `multiply()` divides instead of multiplying
- `if` statements always execute the `else` branch
- `loop` executes exactly once
- Saving files crashes the program (because saving is overrated)

## Example Program

```useless

} else {
    print("False!");   // Always executes
}
```
